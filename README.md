# Biogenesys-Laboratories---COVID-in-LATAM
Project Scope: Optimizing Pharmaceutical Lab Expansion in LATAM for BIOGENESYS  In this exciting endeavor, we delve into the world of pharmaceutical expansion. My mission? To pinpoint the perfect locations for BIOGENESYSâ€™s new labs across Latin America (LATAM). ðŸŒŽðŸ’Š

As a Data Analyst, I was tasked with a crucial project for **BIOGENESYS**, a pharmaceutical company aiming to identify the optimal locations for expanding its pharmaceutical labs. This analysis was based on data from COVID-19 incidence, vaccination rates, and the availability of healthcare infrastructure in Latin America. The ultimate goal was to improve the companyâ€™s response to the effects of the pandemic and post-pandemic environment, ensuring broader access to vaccines.

### Objectives:
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on COVID-19 incidence and other relevant factors to identify trends and opportunities through statistics, measurements, and visualizations.
- Apply data cleaning techniques to ensure data quality, facilitating reliable analysis and strategic decision-making.
- Implement efficient ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to enhance access to data, improving the efficacy of analysis and decision-making.
- Develop interactive dashboards with efficient visualizations, enabling strategic decision-making by exploring data from multiple perspectives.

Through my analysis, I aimed to offer valuable insights on strategic locations for future labs and vaccination centers, addressing vaccine demand, distribution logistics, and existing healthcare infrastructure. This demographic and trend analysis was key to understanding the market environment in Colombia, Argentina, Chile, Mexico, Peru, and Brazil.

### **First Phase: Data Loading and Transformation**

For this first phase, I focused on the dataset provided, which was substantialâ€”around 21 GB, with approximately 22 million records and 707 columns. To facilitate this, the data engineering team provided a smaller, Latin America-focused dataset with 12,216,057 rows and 50 columns. My goal was to ensure that this refined dataset was clean and ready for the subsequent analysis stages. Proper data preparation and cleaning are fundamental for any reliable analysis.

### **Second Phase: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualization**

With the data cleaned, I moved into exploratory data analysis to extract valuable insights that would guide the strategic planning of BIOGENESYSâ€™s lab expansion. By creating clear and detailed visualizations, I sought to uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies in COVID-19 incidence rates, vaccination coverage, and healthcare infrastructure. The insights derived from this phase helped direct leadership toward the best locations for maximizing the positive impact on public health.

### **Third Phase: Advanced EDA with Numpy and Pandas**

In this stage, I performed a deeper analysis of the data related to COVID-19 incidence. Using advanced techniques in **NumPy** and **Pandas**, I refined and prepared the data for advanced visualization. The purpose of this step was to provide precise recommendations regarding the most strategic locations for BIOGENESYSâ€™s lab expansion.

### **Fourth Phase: Practical Applications â€“ Integration with Power BI**

In this final phase, I focused on integrating and presenting the analytical findings, using **Power BI** for visualization and reporting. My objective was to synthesize all the prior analysis into interactive dashboards and reports, which would guide strategic decision-making for the expansion of labs and vaccination centers. These insights prioritized investment areas based on COVID-19 incidence and other critical factors.
